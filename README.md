GPX route converter
===================
The aim of this simple Java tool is to convert VFR flight plans produced with the free software [VfrFlight](http://www.vfrflight.org) to GPX and viceversa.

VfrFlight
---------
VfrFlight is a free, cross platform tool for VFR flight planning. It can be used for real world flight planning and training in FSX / FSX:SE / Prepar3D / X-Plane 10/11 and FlightGear.  
Unfortunately VfrFlight it is not supporting the GPX format (version 2.3.1) and that where GPXrouteConverter comes into play.

GPX
---
GPX is an open XML schema that allows to store in a file collections of: way points, routes and tracks. It is always more used by many GPS devices and applications, because this format is independent from any GPS device producer it is often used to exchange data between devices and softwares of different brands. For example: also with the popular GoogleEarth it is possible to open GPX files and see routes and tracks even in 3D view. More information about the GPX format can be found on its [official website](https://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp).  
A GPX flight plan can be then loaded (and flown) on other free and open source software such as [LK8000](https://www.lk8000.it/)
